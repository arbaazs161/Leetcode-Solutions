1. Start with the root
2. Traverse all the leftmost nodes until leaf node is found.
3. Use inorder traversal to print all leaf nodes
4. Traverse all Rightmost nodes from root and store them in reverse order in the result.

The above method stores nodes in anti-clockwise direction. Do the reverse to traverse clockwise.
